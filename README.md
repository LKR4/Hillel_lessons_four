# Hillel_lessons_four(HW 8)
1. Implemented a custom command to generate users with parameters (name\pass\email)
2. Implemented a custom command that deletes users except for the superuser
3. A file of fixtures was created using dumpdata, in the repository for the file (one full, on the second I trained leaving only user data)
